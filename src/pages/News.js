          <h3>Delay with book "Cybernetics, Cyberware and Cyborgs"</h3>
          <p>Date: 06/09/2023</p>
          <p>
            Sorry everyone. I'm looking for a forward (book introduction) from a person discussed
            within the book who lives overseas that I would like to personally visit first.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can't give an ETA as I'm busy with life (mostly volunteering in Sydney & studying in
            my spare time so forgive me) but expect hopefully by end 2024.
          </p>

          <h3>Let's make YouTube/Tik Tok vids on Cyborgs together!</h3>
          <p>
            I'm looking for non paid hobby film makers to I'm looking to start shooting a 10+ min
            monthly ongoing documentary series on Cyborgs, Disability, Biomedical Engineering,
            androids and Posthumanism. This will be casual filming in our careers free times.
            Please share for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            With guest speakers such as professors, doctors and cyborgs etc., with various
            universities, hospitals, etc., we'll get to experience seeing body parts replaced
            for prosthetics, androids, hospitals in surgery, chasing Steve Haworth's creations,
            and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot pay you (sad I know I'm not Scrooge McDuck) and we'll be using existing
            filming gear (Hero 9-11, with Rode Mics, MacBook Pro's for editing etc.,).
          </p>
